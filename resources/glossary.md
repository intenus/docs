| CoW (Coincidence of Wants)                        | A situation where two parties each have what the other wants, enabling direct peer-to-peer exchange without intermediate transactions. |
| IGS (Intenus General Standard)                    | The universal schema framework that standardizes intent representation across all DeFi operations within the Intenus Protocol.         |
| Intent                                            | A declarative expression of a user's desired outcome without specifying the execution path.                                            |
| MEV (Maximum Extractable Value)                   | The maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of standard block rewards and gas fees.                        |
| PTB (Programmable Transaction Block)              | Sui's atomic transaction composition feature that enables complex multi-operation transactions in a single execution.                  |
| RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) | A machine learning technique that incorporates human feedback to improve model performance and alignment.                              |
| Slashing                                          | The penalty mechanism that deducts staked tokens from misbehaving solvers as punishment for protocol violations.                       |
| Solver                                            | An entity that competes to provide optimal execution strategies for user intents within the protocol.                                  |
| Soulbound Token                                   | A non-transferable NFT that represents identity, credentials, or reputation that cannot be sold or transferred.                        |
| TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)               | A secure area of a processor that ensures code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.     |
| USN (Universal Solver Network)                    | The decentralized network of competing solvers that operate on standardized intent representations within Intenus Protocol.            |
